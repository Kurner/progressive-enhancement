        <h2>In nature, <span class="Good">Good</span> & Evil do not exist.</br> The Universe itself is neither <span class="good">good</span> nor <span class="bad">bad</span>, but a potential in permanent development.</h2>


        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">In life, there are 4 types of people.
            <li>- people who think the Internet is <span class="good">good</span>,</li>
            <li>- people who think the Internet is evil,</li>
            <li>- people who think the Internet is cats,</li>
            <li>- people who don't think about it.</li>

        <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face.</br> From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.</br> Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p>

        <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.</br> Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message.</br> That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.</br> That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.</br> If we mis translate the message, our reality changes.</br> If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.</br> Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>

        <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine.</br> Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.</br> But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.</br> Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</br> That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</br> They said, <span class="villagersQuote">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span></br> The farmer said, <span class="farmerQuote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span></br> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,</br> and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="villagersQuote">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span></br> The farmer again said, <span class="farmerQuote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span></p> 

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</br> The neighbors then said, <span class="villagersQuote">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span></br> and the farmer responded,<span class="farmerQuote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span></br>  The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</br>Again all the neighbors came around and said, <span class="villagersQuote">“Isn’t that great!”</span></br>    Again, he said, <span class="farmerQuote">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span></p>

        <figure class="quote">

            <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</q>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4> 

        <span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.</br> Let's not make a big deal out of it...
